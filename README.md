Live Application Demo: https://gamerrep.herokuapp.com/index


This is a demo application of a Gamer Review System.

This application was built with a Ruby on Rails backend, and a React Front End utlizing Webpacker to compile the Javascript

The application is in continuous development and the data on the demo is no permanent and is subject to change at the creator's disgression.

The idea is to provide gamers with a chance to accurately recount their experiences with other gamers while also providing positive and constructive feedback. Using an ever expanding array of questions, the application compiles reviewers answers and calculates a total Gamer Rep Score. Another goal of this application is data transparency. Gamers get frustrated when they cannot see inside the 'black box' whether it's a matchmaker or a scoring system. That is why a Gamer can view all of their individual scores from reviews as well as their total aggregate scores. We hope this promotes gamers to provide positive and constructive feedback for other gamers so that everyone can have a better gaming experience.
